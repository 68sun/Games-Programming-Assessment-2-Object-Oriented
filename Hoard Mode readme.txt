Hoard Mode
Hoard Mode is an endless, wave-based top down shooter survival. 
Players try to survive as long as they can to try and get the highest score they can.
Pickups such as medkits to heal the player or more powerful weapons appear for a limited time throughout the game.
When a player picks up a new weapon, they discard any previous weapon pickups they had. They do however always have a pistol.

Controls:
Press/hold LMB (Left mouse button) to shoot
WASD to move
R to restart after game over
